# Source Academy Images
This is code from a contest from a course CS1101S, that is based on creating the best image.
The goal was to minimize the number of tokens used, in the highly constrained subset language of Javascript, https://source-academy.github.io/source/source_1/. The motivation will be to regenerate from a string, which is 1 token, any image you want.

# Instructions
Copy the code onto https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground,
Set from 'None' to 'Runes' to allow for images.
Set execution time to 10000.

Hit the run button.
Rerun if you hit a timeout.
